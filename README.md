# Datacom MongoDB Contact Site - Mission 6

This is my implementation of the Datacom contact page, which posts data to a MongoDB database. I designed the replica of Datacom's page myself.

Upon cloning the project, run `npm install` and then `npm start`

OR

If using Docker, then you can use `docker compose up`
